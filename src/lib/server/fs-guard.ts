/**
 * Guard for the filesystem-browser endpoints (`/api/system/files*`).
 *
 * Dockhand runs in a container, so there is no host filesystem to leak — users
 * are allowed to browse the container freely (they need this to find/adopt
 * external stacks). The only things that must never be readable are Dockhand's
 * own secrets:
 *   - the database directory ($DATA_DIR/db, contains dockhand.db)
 *   - the encryption key file ($DATA_DIR/.encryption_key)
 *   - /proc — /proc/<pid>/environ exposes process env vars, including
 *     DATABASE_URL (Postgres credentials) and ENCRYPTION_KEY. The whole tree is
 *     blocked because /proc/self, /proc/1, etc. all leak the same secrets and
 *     nothing legitimate is browsed there.
 *
 * isProtectedPath resolves symlinks (via the nearest existing ancestor) so a
 * symlink pointing into a protected location can't be used to bypass the check.
